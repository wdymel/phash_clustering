# Phash clustering
This was a group project for a artificial intelligence class with the goal of creating a tool for clustering images possibly to be used by some websites.

## Why use phash and not some sort of neural network to recognise/cluster simmilar images?
We decided to use phashing as it is much simpler to implement. It's also significantly faster which is important as potential websites could be hosting milions of images and have hundres more uploaded every second. That would mean having to compare each of those hundred images with all of the already uploaded ones in just a second. Phashig can fit that role because of it's speed.

## How does a phash works
TODO later

## Examples (where does phash works and where it fails)
